# Members Only

"An exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it."

This is part of the 'Members Only' project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at https://www.theodinproject.com
